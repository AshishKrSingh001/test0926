BCA-604 Project and Viva
The objective of the BCA project work is to develop a quality software solution by following the
software engineering principles and practices. During the development of the project the students
should involve in all the stages of the software development life cycle (SDLC). The main objective
of this project course is to provide learners a platform to demonstrate their practical and theoretical
skills gained during five semesters of study in BCA Programme. During project development
students are expected to define a project problem, do requirements analysis, systems design,
software development, apply testing strategies and do documentation with an overall emphasis on
the development of a robust, efficient and reliable software systems. The project development
process has to be consistent and should follow standard.. For example database tables designed in
the system should match with the E-R Diagram. SRS documents to be created as per IEEE
standards.
Students are encouraged to spend maximum time of the sixth semester working on a project
preferably in a software industry or any research organization. Topics selected should be complex
and large enough to justify as a BCA final semester project. The courses studied by the students
during the BCA Programme provide them the comprehensive background knowledge on diverse
subject areas in computer science such as computer programming, data structure, DBMS, Computer
Organization, SAD, Software Engineering, Computer Networks etc., which will be helping students
in doing project work.
